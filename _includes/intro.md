Hi there, my name is Lawrence and I am currently a Software Engineering
student at the University of Waterloo.

I study engineering but I am also entrepreneurial. I enjoy building products
that solve concrete real-world problems. *Impact* and *ownership* are my top two
career values.

I have also done a lot of internships in the past. Check out [my résumé]({{
