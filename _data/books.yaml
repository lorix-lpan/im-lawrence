        I have been hearing people talking about climate change for years.
        However, I never got the chance to dig into it, until recently I read
        Ryan Orbuch's post on Carbon removal
        https://www.orbuch.com/carbon-removal/. This book was brieifly mentioned
        in the post. I decided to give it a read because of the credibility of
        the author as well as the publisher. This book is my first stab at this
        climate tech rabbit hole.

        Climate change is happening because we have emitted too much CO2. There
        are many ways to address it: mitigation (don't emit as much CO2),
        adaption (just change our lifestyle to deal with this rise of
        temperature), Carbon Dioxide removal (trying to capture CO2 in the
        atomsphere), etc. The author suggests that mitigation would be the most
        effective way in the long run.

        There are many mitigation techniques. The two most popular ones are (1)
        moving towards newable energy sources such as Hydro, Nuclear, Wind,
        Solar; and (2) lowering the CO2 emission of existing fossil fuel plants
        using the technique of Carbon Capture.

        The book primarily focuses on Carbon Capture. The first half of the book
        provides an overview of the history as well as the current state (as of
        2018) of the Carbon Capture technology. I learned the different ways of
        reducing CO2 emission from coal plants, as well as how we would store
        these captured CO2.

        The book also brieifly touches on NETs (negative emission technologies).
        The author suggests that currently NETs are not scalable enough. The
        most popular NET is planting trees, and it is still orders of magnitude
        away from the target. However, NETs do get more hype from the public due
        to the simplicity of its concept.

        The second half of the book discusses the current political climate
        around addressing climate change. There are two ways for policy makers
        to address climate change: "market pull" and "technology push". Market
        pull is about implementing the carbon tax. The author thinks it is the
        most effective approach because we could just let the market decide on
        what would be the best technology to address climate change. However,
        this strategy is not favoured by most politicians because carbon tax
        might impact their reelection. For example, they will lose votes from
        people who have long commutes by car. Also it is not fair since many
        states (eg. Washington) have geographical advantages so they could build
        hydro plants, but many states do not have this advantage so they have to
        rely on fossil fuels (eg. West Virginia). Technology push is about
        government giving out grants to fund R&D that addresses climate change.
        However, it would be up to the government to pick who would receive the
        grant, so it is more biased than the "Market Pull" approach.

        The author argues that we should not soley rely on renewable energy,
        since solar and wind plants are not very reliable; not every region can
        build hydro plants; and nuclear is controversial. In addition, since the
        majority of the power plants are fossil-fuel-based, implementing Carbon
        Capture is significantly cheaper than migrating them to renewable energy
        plants.

        Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It fed my curiosity and I learned a
        lot about the current landscape of addressing climate change. However, I
        suspect that the author might be biased towards "Carbon Capture" over
        other mitigation technology.

        I was also surprised by how political the issue of climate change is.
        The technology seems to be ready. The only bottleneck is public
        policies, which are influenced by the economy and the culture (how the
        voters perceive this). I wonder what I can do to contribute to this
        effort.

        The first half of the book provides a philosophical view on
        entrepreneurship/innovation.

        One takeaway I have is how Thiel redefines monopoly. Monopolies
        don't need to fixate on their competition so they can focus on making
        progress.

        He has also been stressing the importance of "thinking for yourself".
        Our society has transitioned from "definite optimism" to "indefinite
        optimism". People, who are extremely smart and could have created 0-1
        ventures, go into lucrative industries such as investment banking simply
        because they are "safe". As how Thiel put it in the book: "What could be
        a more appropriate reward for two decades of resume-building than a
        seemingly elite, process-oriented career that promises to 'keep options
        open'". This is actually coherent with his "Thiel fellowship" program.
        He is not encouraging people to not go to college. Instead, he wants
        those who are capable to drop out of this "conventional path", and make
        0 to 1 changes to our society to make it better.

        The second half of the book discusses the methodology to create such 0
        to 1 ventures. For example, he encourages to entrepreneurs to take over
        small niche markets, and to "monopolize" small things.

        I really enjoy reading this book, especially learning about Thiel's view
        on innovation. This book made me realize that I haven't been thinking
        for myself, and consequently motivated me to write
        https://lpan.io/next-big-thing/. I encourage EVERYONE, especially
        university students studying CS, to give it a read.
