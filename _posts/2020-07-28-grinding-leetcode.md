When I was in my freshman year, I hated the technical interview process simply
because I did not enjoy practicing Leetcode problems. It is one of those dumb
things in college that if you don’t do it, others will get ahead of you.

It was hard for a college kid to accept that life is unfair. Why do I need to do
something I don’t like to get something I want? In one of my technical
interviews during my freshman year, the interviewer asked me if I like
algorithms when he greeted me since the interview was about testing my
algorithmic skill (Leetcode skill). I told him to his face that I hate
algorithms. I also made sure to mention that I thought his interview process was
stupid. I didn’t get the job. Not too surprising!

Today I am a fourth-year student about to graduate. I was on the phone yesterday
chatting with a younger friend who was stressed about his upcoming internship
search. He asked me for advice because he thinks I am an expert at internship
hunting. And of course, being extremely flattered, I told him to grind Leetcode.

Pretty ironic right? Not to mention that the young lad also hates practicing
Leetcode questions. He prefers building side projects, code that makes a
real-life impact.

I told him, like how the seniors told me back in the days: life is hard; now go
home and grind Leetcode.

Did I change my mind? Not really. I still think grinding Leetcode is dumb. But
it is a necessary evil until companies realize it is dumb. The good news is that
many companies have already [revamped their SWE hiring
process](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards).

Coding is about translating one’s thought process into code. In the real world,
software engineers translate business logic (what they want the computer to do)
into maintainable and performant code. The purpose of whiteboard interviews is
to ensure the candidate knows how to do this translation. They give you the
specification in the form of a programming puzzle. Then, it is your
responsibility to translate it into code.

Here is an example successful whiteboard interview from the candidate’s
perspective
1. Understand the programming puzzle
2. Come up with an algorithm to solve the puzzle
3. Implement the algorithm (translate thoughts into code)

In my opinion, only the third step somewhat reflects one’s real-world
programming skills. Grinding Leetcode will help you to be good at all three
steps. However, being good at the first two steps is not useful for software
engineering roles.

So, should you grind Leetcode? You tell me.
