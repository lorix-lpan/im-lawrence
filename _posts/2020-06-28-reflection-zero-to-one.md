The first half of the book provides a philosophical view on
entrepreneurship/innovation. For example, Thiel praises monopoly. Monopolies
don't need to fixate on their competition so they can focus on making progress.

He has also been stressing the importance of "thinking for yourself". Our
society has transitioned from "definite optimism" to "indefinite optimism".
People, who are extremely smart and could have created 0-1 ventures, go into
lucrative industries such as investment banking simply because these professions
are "safe". As how Thiel puts it in the book: "What could be a more appropriate
reward for two decades of resume-building than a seemingly elite,
process-oriented career that promises to 'keep options open'". This is actually
coherent with his "Thiel fellowship" program. He is not encouraging people to
not go to college. Instead, he wants those who are capable to drop out of this
"conventional path", and make 0 to 1 changes to our society to make it better.

The second half of the book discusses the methodology to create such 0 to 1
ventures. For example, he encourages to entrepreneurs to take over small niche
markets, and to "monopolize" small things.

I really enjoyed reading this book, especially learning about Thiel's view on
entrepreneurship. This book made me realize that I haven't been thinking for
myself, and consequently motivated me to write

encourage EVERYONE, especially university students studying CS, to give it a
read.
