# About me

My name is Lawrence Pan (lpan) and I am a Software Engineering student at the
University of Waterloo.

I am interested in distributed systems and cloud-native infrastructure. I have
read Martin Kleppmann's [Designing Data-Intensive
Applications](http://dataintensive.net/), Brendan Burns' [Designing Distributed
Systems](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/designing-distributed-systems/en-us/),
a good chunk of [The Linux Programming Interface](http://man7.org/tlpi/), and
most of [Google's SRE book](https://landing.google.com/sre/).

I have also taken [relevant courses in
school](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/ENG-Software-Engineering), such
as Algorithms, Operation System, Computer Networks, etc.

In my spare time, besides hanging out with friends, I love practicing Yoga,
dancing, lifting weights, and reading books (listening to audio books). I also
love dogs, especially Golden Retrievers!
