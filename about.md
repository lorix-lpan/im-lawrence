# About me

My name is Lawrence Pan (lpan) and I am a Software Engineering student at the
University of Waterloo.

I am interested in distributed systems, low-level system programming, and
Cloud-native infrastructure. I have read Martin Kleppmann's [Designing
Data-Intensive Applications](http://dataintensive.net/), a good chunk of [The
Linux Programming Interface](http://man7.org/tlpi/), and most of [Google's SRE
book](https://landing.google.com/sre/).

In my spare time, besides chilling with my friends, I love practicing Yoga,
lifting weights, and reading books (listening to audio books). I also love dogs,
especially Golden Retrievers!
