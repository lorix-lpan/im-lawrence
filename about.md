# About me

## Summary

My name is Lawrence Pan (lpan) and I am a Software Engineering student at the
University of Waterloo.

I am interested in distributed systems, low-level system programming, and
Cloud-native infrastructure. I have read Martin Kleppmann's [Designing
Data-Intensive Applications](http://dataintensive.net/), a good chunk of [The
Linux Programming Interface](http://man7.org/tlpi/), and most of [Google's SRE
book](https://landing.google.com/sre/).

In my spare time, besides chilling with my friends, I love practicing Yoga,
lifting weights, and reading books (listening to audio books).

I also LOVE dogs, especially Golden Retrievers!

## Work experience

I have done four internships in the past.

I interned as a front-end developer working with React and Redux. Did back-end
work with Rails and MongoDB. I also got a chance to work on a low-latency data
pipeline, written in Golang, that processes millions of data points per second!
Recently, I interned as an infrastructure engineer and worked with modern
cloud-native technologies such as Kubernetes, Spinnaker, and Istio.
